This project will use vagrant and puppet to 
install a complete Socorro (https://github.com/mozilla/socorro) 
environment in a local VM.

---
INSTALL
---

1) Install http://www.virtualbox.org/

2) Run vagrant (http://vagrantup.com/) :

 Install vagrant from http://vagrantup.com/

 # NOTE: if you have a 32-bit host, change "lucid64" to "lucid32"
 vagrant box add socorro-all http://files.vagrantup.com/lucid64.box
 
 vagrant up

3) Add 33.33.33.10 to /etc/hosts:

33.33.33.10	crash-stats crash-reports socorro-api

4) Enjoy your Socorro environment!

browse UI:      http://crash-stats
submit crashes: http://crash-reports/submit (HTTP POST only)
query data:     http://socorro-api/bpapi/201005/adu/byday/p/GenericProduct/v/1.0/rt/any/osx/start/2011-07-27/end/2011-08-03

SSH into your VM:
 vagrant ssh

The Socorro checkout is in:
/home/socorro/dev/socorro

Socorro documentation (including developer docs) can be found at: http://socorro.readthedocs.org/

The Socorro files will be installed to /data/socorro/. You will need to restart
the apache2 or supervisord services if you modify middleware or backend code.

By default, vagrant will share your socorro checkout in ../ with the VM 
in /home/socorro/dev/socorro

You can do this from the host by running "vagrant provision".

LOADING DATA
---

If you are starting a new Socorro database, refer to: http://socorro.readthedocs.org/en/latest/populatepostgres.html

Or, if you have access to an existing Socorro database snapshot, you can load it like so:

 # shut down database users
 sudo /etc/init.d/supervisor force-stop
 sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 stop

 # drop old db and load snapshot
 sudo su - postgres
 dropdb breakpad
 createdb -E 'utf8' -l 'en_US.utf8' -T template0 breakpad
 pg_restore -Fc -d breakpad minidb.dump

This may take several hours, depending on your hardware. One way to speed this up would
be to :

* add more CPU cores to the VM (via virtualbox GUI), default is 1
* add "-j n" to pg_restore command above, where n is number of CPU cores - 1

KNOWN ISSUES

* HBase
** need to install LZO, remove sed hack
* topcrash reports
** the CSV dataload + backfill does not seem to work for this yet
* cronjobs are not run in the vagrant environment
